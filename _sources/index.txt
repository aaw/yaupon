Welcome to yaupon
============================

yaupon is a :term:`graph` library written in Python_. Some of the
goals of yaupon include:

   * A simple graph interface that works well with in-memory 
     graphs, large graphs that can't be held in memory all at 
     once, and even infinite, lazily generated graphs
   * Efficient implementations of graph and tree classes
   * Easy-to-use suites of graph algorithm implementations: find
     the shortest path in a graph by calling *shortest_path*,
     not by figuring out exactly which shortest path algorithm 
     you need.
   * Clear, comprehensive documentation
