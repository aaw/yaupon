yaupon is a graph library written in Python. Some of the goals of yaupon 
include:

- A simple graph interface that works well with in-memory graphs, large graphs 
  that canâ€™t be held in memory all at once, and even infinite, lazily 
  generated graphs
- Efficient implementations of graph and tree classes
- Easy-to-use suites of graph algorithm implementations: find the shortest 
  path in a graph by calling shortest_path, not by figuring out exactly which 
  shortest path algorithm you need.
- Clear, comprehensive documentation.

Developer notes

yaupon is currently tested against Python 2.6, and has no other dependencies 
unless you want to build the documentation or run tests.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run tests, you'll need py.test from py lib. Using easy_install from 
setuptools or Distribute, just run

easy_install -U py

Then change to the top-level yaupon directory and run "py.test".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build docs, you'll need Sphinx, which you can also easy_install with:

easy_install -U Sphinx

You probably also want pygments for syntax highlighting:

easy_install -U pygments

Go to the doc directory and run the build-docs script.
